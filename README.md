# Email-Spam-Detection-ML
A machine learning project that classifies emails as Spam or Ham using text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and multiple classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest.
# 📧 Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to automatically detect spam emails using machine learning techniques. The dataset is preprocessed using NLP methods and transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF. Multiple ML models are trained and compared to find the best-performing classifier.
